Reading alignments for sample 'sample1' and detecting alleles ...
Found 22 reads covering 2 variants
Kept 14 reads that cover at least two variants each
Reducing coverage to at most 15X by selecting most informative reads ...
Selected 14 reads covering 2 variants
Best-case phasing would result in 1 non-singleton phased blocks (1 in total)
... after read selection: 1 non-singleton phased blocks (1 in total)
Variants covered by at least one phase-informative read in at least one individual after read selection: 2
